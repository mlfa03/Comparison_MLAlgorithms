## Machine Learning with Numpy and Pandas only

Implementing machine learning algorithms without using the traditional machine learning libraries (tensor flow, pytorch, sklearn etc..)

The goal of this is to make use I can understand how the algorithms work which will make much easier to choose an algorithm for a future project.
